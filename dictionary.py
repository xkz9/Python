#  A dictionary contains multiple key, value pairs that can be printed out. 
# mydict = {
#     "name" : "Leonardo",
#     "age" : "10",
#     "grade" : "5"
# }
# print(mydict["grade"])
# print(mydict["age"])
# mydict["age"] = 15 ---- Sets age to 15
# mydict["grade"] = 10 ---- Sets grade to 10
# mydict["fruit"] = "mango" ---- Creates new variable and sets it to "x" 
# mydict.pop("name") ---- Pop works in dictionarys, as well as lists to remove a certain value by removing  acertain key value pair by putting a key in it.
# mydict.popitem() ---- This removes the last key value pair in the dictionary 
# print(mydict.keys()) ---- Shows all keys ONLY
# print(mydict.values) ---- Shows all values ONLY
# print(mydict.items) ---- Shows both keys and values 
# print(mydict)

# Find how many times each number is mentioned in the list.
